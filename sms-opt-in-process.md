# SMS Messaging Opt-In Process

This document outlines the process by which users opt in to receive SMS messages from our toll-free number.

## Opt-In Method: Direct SMS Keyword Opt-In

Our service uses a straightforward SMS keyword-based opt-in process:

1. Users are informed about our SMS service through one of the following methods:
   * In-person verbal communication
   * Printed materials (business cards, flyers, or signage)
   * Email communication
   * Social media posts

2. The promotional materials clearly display:
   * Our toll-free number: **+1 (888) 857-1421**
   * The keyword to text: **"MEETUP"**
   * A brief description: **"Get same-day meetup suggestions with friends based on your availability"**
   * Information that standard message and data rates may apply

3. To opt in, users text the keyword **"MEETUP"** to our toll-free number

4. Our system automatically responds with a confirmation message: **"MeetSync: To receive same-day meetup suggestions with friends, reply YES to confirm. Message & data rates may apply. Msg frequency varies. Reply STOP to cancel anytime."**

5. Users must reply **"YES"** to complete the subscription process (double opt-in)

6. After replying YES, users receive a welcome message confirming their successful enrollment: **"Welcome to MeetSync! You'll now receive daily availability checks and meetup suggestions when your friends are free at the same time. Reply HELP for assistance or STOP to unsubscribe."**

## Opt-Out Process

Users can opt out of receiving SMS messages at any time by:

1. Replying **"STOP"** to any of our SMS messages

2. Upon receiving the STOP command, our system immediately confirms the opt-out with a message: **"You have been unsubscribed from MeetSync messages. No more messages will be sent. Reply MEETUP to resubscribe."**

We also honor other standard opt-out keywords such as:
* CANCEL
* UNSUBSCRIBE
* END
* QUIT

## Record Keeping

Our SMS opt-in and opt-out system maintains records of:
* Phone numbers that have opted in
* Date and time of opt-in
* The specific keyword used for opt-in
* Confirmation of double opt-in completion
* Date and time of any opt-out requests
* All message interactions with the user

These records are securely stored and can be accessed if needed for compliance verification.

## Explicit Consent Practices

Our opt-in process ensures that:
* Consent is explicitly obtained through affirmative action (replying YES)
* Consent is never bundled with other terms or conditions
* Consent is not required to use our primary services
* Users are clearly informed about message frequency and potential carrier charges
* The opt-in process follows a "double opt-in" approach for maximum clarity

## Sample Messages

Below are examples of the types of messages users will receive after opting in:

1. Morning availability check: **"MeetSync: Good morning! When are you free today? Reply with time ranges like '12-2pm, after 5pm' or 'lunch, evening'"**

2. Match notification: **"MeetSync: Match found! You, Sarah, and Michael are all free at 4:30pm today. Reply YES to confirm, or ALT for other options."**

3. Confirmation message: **"MeetSync: Great! You're meeting Sarah and Michael at 4:30pm today. Suggested: Byte Cafe (walkable for everyone). Reply with DETAILS for location info or CHAT to start a group thread."**

## Examples of Promotional Materials

Our promotional materials that advertise the SMS service look like this:

**Example Flyer Text:** "Connect with friends spontaneously! Text MEETUP to +1 (888) 857-1421 to get same-day hangout suggestions when your schedules align. Message & data rates may apply. Reply STOP anytime to cancel."

**Example Verbal Script for In-Person Opt-In:** "Would you like to get notifications when your friends are free at the same time as you? MeetSync checks your availability each morning and suggests meetups when schedules align. Just text the word MEETUP to +1 (888) 857-1421. After texting MEETUP, you'll need to reply YES to confirm. You can unsubscribe at any time by replying STOP."
